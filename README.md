# üåç Climate Odyssey üöÄ

## High-Level Summary
**Climate Odyssey** invites users on an immersive journey through the Earth's climate story, offering an interactive narrative that highlights the evolution of our planet‚Äôs climate from its beginnings to the present day. Users engage with a common plot that establishes the historical context of climate change, followed by a personalized second plot that evolves based on their choices‚Äîwhether they decide to take action to protect the environment or remain passive. The experience is enriched with quizzes that assess users' carbon footprints, interactive mini-games such as the Waste Management Game and Water Saver Game, a dedicated page for sharing individual climate stories, and a pledge page to commit to sustainable practices. This holistic approach aims to connect users to their unique roles in the ongoing climate narrative.

## üìú Project Details
**Climate Odyssey** invites users on an immersive journey through the Earth's climate story, offering an interactive narrative that highlights the evolution of our planet‚Äôs climate from its beginnings to the present day. Users engage with a common plot that establishes the historical context of climate change, followed by a personalized second plot that evolves based on their choices‚Äîwhether they decide to take action to protect the environment or remain passive. The experience is enriched with quizzes that assess users' carbon footprints, interactive mini-games such as the Waste Management Game and Water Saver Game, a dedicated page for sharing individual climate stories, and a pledge page to commit to sustainable practices. This holistic approach aims to connect users to their unique roles in the ongoing climate narrative.

Users start their journey by exploring the shared plot that narrates the climate story of Earth, detailing critical events and milestones that have shaped our environment over time. This foundational knowledge sets the stage for users to reflect on their own choices in the second plot. After gaining insight into the overarching climate narrative, users are presented with decisions that can either positively impact the planet or choose inaction.

As they navigate this personalized experience, users can take quizzes to determine their carbon footprints, providing valuable feedback on how their lifestyles affect the climate. The Waste Management Game challenges users to classify different types of waste as recyclable, compostable, or landfill material, reinforcing the importance of proper waste disposal and recycling practices. Meanwhile, the Water Saver Game allows users to engage in activities that save water, enabling them to earn points for their efforts in conservation. Both games serve as interactive tools that emphasize the significance of individual actions within the climate story.

Moreover, the platform features a dedicated space for users to share their own climate stories, fostering a sense of community and encouraging others to contribute positively to the environment. By taking a pledge to commit to sustainable practices, users reinforce their role in shaping the climate story of the future. This interconnected approach not only educates but also empowers users to become active participants in the ongoing narrative of climate change.
